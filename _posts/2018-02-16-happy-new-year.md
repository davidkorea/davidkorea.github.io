## This is the first day of the lunar year of dog in China.

#### Although the network does have a delay when connecting with github, much more time being wasted because the time delay. Still, yea!! a very good and happy first day of this year!

#### When I got up ths morning after a big party that we all families got together last night. Mom was preparing a big breakfast and my brothers came to my house as well to spend the new year's first day together.

#### Checking my phone messages as usual and call back to Aiden, beyond my expectation, i missed his calls twice early in this morning, a 'happy new year' greeting to him and also to his kind grandmother.

#### Going out and watched an interesting movie 'Monster Hunt' in the cinaema and have a big dinner we 3 brothers in a grill meat restaurant.

#### When back home, a warm-hearted message from Aiden which is saying that his families were talking about me this morning and praised me a lot. SAME! SAME! ALRIGHT??? To be honest, i was really happy to meet Aiden and his families treated me as a member of his family. All the memories make me feel i am not alone in a foreign country and like any other Korean people who have a family. I become not to fear of anything around me because i know i have my family here!

### A good beginning should be the half of success! 
### Be Happy, Be Strong, Be Healthy!
### Best Wishes to every one of my families both in China and Korea.
