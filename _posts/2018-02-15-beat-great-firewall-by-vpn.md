> Right, don't wanna say anything about this, but, at least i'm not the victim. There will be a feeling of achievement when you beat all the blocks and get to the destination finally. just like you need to apply for a visa before you go abroad. hahh~

# 1. Country and area

- select the origin area and language. DON'T change to Chinese/China. both iphone and sumsung.

# 2 Initialize network

- 4G/LTE would be disable when firstly get access to UnicomChina

- For sumsung, LTE whould be fine after the following steps.
  - 연경
  - 해외로밍
  - 로밍환경설정
  - 설정초기화
  
# 3. VPN Master

Maybe, you should be trying several times, connectivity will be ok by trying less than 3 times.
